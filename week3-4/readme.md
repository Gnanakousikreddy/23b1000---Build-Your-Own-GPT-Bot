## `milestone2` –  LSTM-Based Movie Review Sentiment Classifier

**Objective:**  
Build an LSTM-based model to perform binary sentiment classification on movie reviews (positive/negative).

 **Results:**
- Achieved an accuracy of **86.75%**
- Optimized through **extensive hyperparameter tuning**
- Experimented with variations in model **architecture**, such as:
  - Number of LSTM layers
  - Hidden sizes
  - Dropout rates
  - Sequence padding techniques

 **Contents:**
- [`sentiment_analysis.ipynb`](./milestone2/sentiment_analysis.ipynb) — Full training pipeline with results and analysis
- Cleaned data and model evaluation cells included
